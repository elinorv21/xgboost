The algorithm, “Ramanujan XGBoost,” uses Ramanujan graphs instead of decision trees in the XGBoost algorithm. 
Ramanujan graphs are well known to be most useful for construction of optimal communication networks.

The document, RamanujanXGBoost.pdf, is a preprint associated with the Ramanujan XGBoost algorithm to appear on ArXiv.org.
The code in the file, ramanujan_xgboost.cpp, is a C++ implementation of the Ramanujan XGBoost algorithm.
